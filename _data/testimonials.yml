  quotes: 
    - I had the pleasure of working closely with Tom on several web development projects during our time at Promantus. Tom is invariably a team player, a quick learner, and a curious and optimistic guy. When he doesn't know the answer to a problem, he never hesitates to dive in, learning as much as he can in a short period of time and coming up with a plan to solve it. As a designer, I can also attest to Tom's attention to detail in implementing software designs. Would love to collaborate again in the future.
