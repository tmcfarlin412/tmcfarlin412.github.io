      summary: "Version 1.0 goals were identified and initial research was conducted to determine the technology of choice for this project. Goals included simple maintenance, minimal architecture, and ability to create static web pages. Off the bat, a static website generator seemed to be an attractive solution due to its minimal architecture. Popular static website generators were compared, and the bidding was narrowed down to Jekyll and Docusaurus. Jekyll was selected, as these sites can be hosted on Github free of charge (thus, easy and cheap maintenance).<br><brIn order to build an attractive site, the method of incorporating Material Web Components needed to be realized. Comparing and testing two methods, one using NPM to install individual components and the other linking to the publiclly available material CSS and JS, it was determined that the latter was a simpler, more maintainable solution. The architecture was thus determined to be a Jekyll site with manually incorporated Material Web Components hosted on Github."
