title: Beating Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain injury
description: "I was diagnosed with bilateral (both hands) carpal tunnel syndrome in Fall of 2016. You will find countless blog posts telling you how terrible carpal tunnel is, and they are all true. You will also find countless routines teaching you how to keep symptoms at bay. Here is what helps me to continue my career."

First, you must research and learn the difference between Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The steps below help mitigate symptoms of both.

**To summarize**

- Think more, type less
- Use voice to text software
- Ice daily for 10 minutes
- Build an ergonomic work setup
- Quit smoking those cigarettes
- Exercise
- Improve your diet
- Stretch throughout day
- Massage hands
- Stay warm

Good luck! Set calendar reminders for each of these steps. Work on a few of these improvements at a time. It is not easy, but it is worth it, and you will get better!

## Think more, type less

Draft your code or texts in your mind before typing, and learn to use hotkeys. Thoughtfully press each key. 

## Use voice to text software

Find a way to use voice to text software, this is a must. Use the built-in accessibility software to write notes, email, and messages whenever possible. This goes for phone use as well (I am speaking these words into my phone). My advice re: voice to code software is do not bother with it. <a href="https://shop.nuance.com/store/nuanceus/Custom/pbpage.dragon-professional-individual-for-mac6-learnMore" target="_blank">Dragon</a> is an investment, but it is worth it.

## Ice daily for 10 minutes

Buy a bucket, buy 4 ice cube trays. Set a calendar reminder for 15 min before you want to climb into bed, and when that reminder alerts you, stop what you are doing and ice. I stand in my kitchen facing away from the counter, bucket of ice water on the counter, and my hands and wrists submerged in ice water behind my back for 10 minutes every night at 9:45 PM. Use this as dedicated meditation or reflection time.

## Build an ergonomic work setup

Learn about proper standing desk ergonomics. Buy an impact mat, mechanical keyboard with cherry MX brown switches and learn to type softly (stop pounding on the keyboard if you do). Buy armrests, a trackpad or mouse, and a laptop stand. Stand at least 50% of the day, and be sure to bend your knees slightly otherwise back issues will be your next problem. 

Here's a picture of my setup, and links to the products.

## Quit smoking those cigarettes

Just another reason to quit, smoking results in poor circulation which will slow healing and worsen your symptoms.
 
## Exercise

Running increases blood flow to hands, and strengthening your upper body will reduce symptoms. I recommend running until you see an improvement in your condition before lifting weights. Also, instead of weights, I'd recommend trying <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine" target="_blank">body weight fitness</a>.

## Improve your diet

Switch to a pescatarian or vegetarian diet for a few months to force yourself to get a better variety of nutrients from fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Be sure to take this step seriously, meal plan to ensure variety, and get used to eating peanuts as a snack.

## Stretch throughout day

Stretch for 5-15 min before you start work, after lunch, and after you finish working for the day. Stretch your entire body, but be sure to stretch your hands and arms.

## Massage hands

When your symptoms decrease and you can comfortably apply pressure, massage your hands after you are done working for the day.

## Stay warm

Invest in some heavy sweaters and sleep with layers, make sure you stay warm at all times to promote circulation.
